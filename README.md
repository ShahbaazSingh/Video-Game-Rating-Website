# Gamepedia

A simple website implementing a database of video game records that users can rate and comment on. Feel free to use my code for learning or suggesting improvements. To run the website, simply run a server such as phpMyAdmin and click on one of the php files for a startup page. I recommend starting with the homepage. The database was created manually and uses SQL.

Enjoy!
